%At the local play group for babies and toddlers, I was asking the mothers about the number of teddies each of their children has. The four children are aged 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
%Remarkably, the children have one, two, three and four teddies, although not necessarily respectively. James has more teddies than his age. John is older than Matthew. Curiously only 
%one child has the same number of teddies as his age. Paul has less teddies than John, and the child aged 3 has two teddies. Paul is the youngest.

%How old is each child and how many teddies do they have each?

set(arithmetic).  
assign(domain_size, 4).

list(distinct).

[James, John, Matthew, Paul].
[t1, t2, t3, t4].

end_of_list.

formulas(assumptions).

%Paul is the youngest, so he is 1 year old
%James has more teddies than his age and Paul is 1 year old, so James can be either 2 or 3 years old
%John being older than Matthew and Paul being 1 means that Matthew can be only 2 or 3 years old and that John can be 3 or 4
%The child aged 3 has two teddies, so that he can't be James so it's either John or Matthew -> James is 2 years old
%There remains two toddlers without an age assigned and they are John and Matthew. John being older than Matthew, it means that
%Matthew is 3 and John is 4
Paul = 0.
James = 1. 
Matthew = 2. 
John = 3.

%Child aged 3(Matthew) has 2 teddies
Matthew = t2.

%James(being 2) can have either 3 or 4 teddies
James = t3 | James = t4.

%Matthew and James both having a number of teddies different to their age, it remains that Paul and John have the same number
%of teddies as their age
Paul = t1 | John = t4.

%If Paul has 3 teddies, then John will have 4 teddies and James 1 that will be in contradiction with this statement:
%"James has more teddies than his age". Paul can't have 4 teddies because that way will have more than John(which is not allowed)
%That remains that John can't have 4 teddies
John != t4.
